A 16x2 LCD is interfaced with an Arduino mega microcontroller board (ATMEGA2560) and the message "Embedded System Programming" is displayed on the LCD screen. The 8 data lines of the LCD are connected to the Port F and the RS and Enable pins are connected to port K of the microcontroller board. Note that bare metal programming is used instead of using Arduino libary functions.
